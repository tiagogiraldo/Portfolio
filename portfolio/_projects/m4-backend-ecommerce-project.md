# Fullstack Developer

This ecommerce backend project uses NestJS to design and implement a robust and scalable API that handles a high volume of requests and provides a seamless user experience. The project follows a well-planned code architecture and uses a Postgres database with TypeORM for data management. It features API endpoints for CRUD operations, validation, pagination, and security measures such as encryption, JWT authentication, and role-based access control. Additionally, the project integrates with Cloudinary for cloud image management and generates documentation using Swagger and Open API. By implementing these features, the project aims to create a secure, efficient, and well-documented backend for an ecommerce application that can handle a large volume of users and transactions.

Project goals:

-Planning and defining the code architecture.

-Initializing Node projects.

-Basic configuration of a project.

-Creating and using NestJS repositories.

-Creating routes for processing requests corresponding to the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) of each entity.

-Creating a Postgres database.

-Validating the body of requests.

-Implementing pagination of results based on the information received in the route.

-Using guards for route protection.

-Creating a Postgresql database.

-Configuring and connecting with TypeORM.

-Creating and defining entities.

-Creating validations using Pipes to validate the information of requests.

-Connecting with Cloudinary for cloud image management.

-Uploading files to a Cloudinary session.

-Consuming images from Cloudinary.

-Implementing encryption and decryption of passwords.

-Signing and validating JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

-Using guards for authentication and route protection.

-Implementing role-based access control.

-Creating documentation for the application using Swagger and Open API.
