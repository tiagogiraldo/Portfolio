# Fullstack Developer

This is a Full Stack application of the Vehicle Technical Inspection System designed to manage appointments for vehicle technical inspections. Built using a combination of React, Express, and TypeScript, the application allows users to create and manage vehicle inspection reports, track maintenance history, and receive notifications when a vehicle is due for revision. The application's backend is powered by a TypeORM database, which stores information on vehicle inspections, maintenance records, and user data. The frontend is built using React, with functional components and Redux state management, allowing for a seamless user experience. The application also features controlled forms for data entry, dynamic routing with parameters, and HTTP requests to the backend API. Additionally, the system implements a lifecycle management system to track the status of vehicle inspections and revisions. By leveraging these technologies, the Car Technical Revision System provides a comprehensive and efficient solution for managing vehicle technical revisions. The data base employed in this project is postgres.
