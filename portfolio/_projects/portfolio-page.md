# Fullstack Developer | Front End

This portfolio is a collection of projects, writings, and code snippets that showcase my interests and expertise in web development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, finance, and Python programming. The projects section features a range of applications and tools that I've built, from web applications to machine learning models, each with its own unique challenges and solutions. 

The blog section is a space for me to share my thoughts and reflections on industry trends, best practices, and emerging technologies. 

The code snippets page is a repository of interesting programming solutions and techniques that I've encountered during my journey as a developer. From useful stuff to elegant solutions, this page is a collection of code that I've found useful and worth sharing. Throughout this portfolio, I aim to provide a glimpse into my problem-solving approach, my design decisions, and my passion for building innovative solutions. 

Built using Next.js, a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated websites, this portfolio is designed to be fast, scalable, and easy to maintain. It is deployed on Vercel, a platform that provides seamless integration with GitHub and automatic code optimization, ensuring that the site is always up-to-date and running smoothly.
