# Machine Learning Developer | Computer Vision

With the goal of enabling clothing search based on images, we developed two feature extractors. The first utilizes deep neural networks, while the second employs a color histogram. Similar clothing search will also be performed in a conditioned manner, based on category prediction, in order to reduce the search space and improve algorithm speed. Category prediction was achieved using CNN without transfer learning.
