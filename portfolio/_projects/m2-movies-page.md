# Fullstack Developer

I've been learning and experimenting with various web development technologies, including front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I've gained experience with DOM manipulation, HTTP requests, and testing with Jest, and I'm familiar with frameworks like Bootstrap and Mongoose. I'm also learning about best practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and asynchronous programming with Promises and Async/Await.

Project goals:

  -DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

  -HTTP requests with AJAX.

  -Applying styles with CSS.

  -Applying styles using the Bootstrap framework.

  -Installing and configuring dependencies with NPM.

  -Testing with Jest.

  -Applying TDD (Test-Driven Development) strategy.

  -Handling asynchronous code with Promises and Async/Await.

  -Developing an HTTP server using the Express library.

  -Creating a MongoDB database cluster.

  -Connecting to a database with Mongoose and MongoDB Atlas.

  -Designing forms and validating data with HTML and JavaScript.

  -Implementing routes and logic with Express.

  -Saving data with Mongoose.

**Tech stack:** JS · HTML5 · CSS · Boostrap · Node.js · Express.js · MongoDB
