# Portfolio

This is my portfolio repository. It is intended to showcase the projects I've built or participated in, and post articles of interest. This 
site supersedes the older tiagogiraldo.github.io, which is no longer maintained. The tech stack applied here are Next.js and Tailwind. The site 
is intended to be deployed on Vercel.
